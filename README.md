# Tinder for GIFs
This project is a site where you can like or dislike gifs, and view them in the "Bekijk Liked GIFs" (Check Liked GIFs) modal. You can click the GIF, both on the card and in your liked gifs, for a more detailed description.

For this project I had to create the app first in vanilla JavaScript, and then the same app in React, Angular and Vue. I am planning to make the same app in the other two frameworks as well, and then I will update this repository.

## How to open?
Choose a branch for which version you want to see the app, and per version, there is a README file to instruct you on how to open the app.
